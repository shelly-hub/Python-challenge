# Python-challenge

This is an exercise to practise the use of Python to analyse 2 excel CSV file, and carry out calculations required.

**Project Description**

The two data we are analysing are in 2 folders each called Pybank, and Pypoll separately.
Each folder will contain an Excel CSV file, a python script, and a text file with the analysis results.
- Pybank folder is used to analyse financial data , to find out the related profits or loss of the company.
- Pypoll folder is used to analyse poll data, to find out the candidates polling results.

Benefits of using Python:
- Python can process this large data in shorten time than when in Excel VBA.
- By changing the Excel CSV file into lists of Phython, the data can be run with shorter Loop runs and less complex code. As compared in Excel VBA larger loop and more complex script needs to be written.

Disadvantage of using Python:
- Needs to be aware of indentations. Indentation can highly affect how the script is being run.
- Needs to know to convert the values in CSV to float, integer and convert back to string when print out messages
- There is no fix order to write python script as the result of each code will change eventually because the codes could affect each others. 
- Printing messages or results in python would be then different before or after subsequent codes written. 

**Method**
1. Need to import libraries into Python
2. Create a path to import Excel CSV file
3. Need to create empty lists or lists dictionaries to hold different type of variables (ie. strings or integer and etc.)
4. Need to set initial values for calculations to run on loop method.
5. In combination with For loop method, If function to filter required results.
6. Print out the results analysis and export to other file into a text.file
