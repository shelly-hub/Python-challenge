# Python-challenge

This is an exercise to practise the used of Python to analyse 2 excel CSV file, and carry out calculations required.

**Project Description**

The two data we are analysing are in 2 folders each called Pybank, and Pypoll separately.
Each folder will contain an Excel CSV file, a python script, and a text file with the analysis results.
- Pybank folder is used to analyse financial data , to find out the related profits or loss of the company.
- Pypoll folder is used to analyse poll data, to find out the candidates polling results.

Benefits of using Python:
- Python can process this large data in shorten time than when in Excel VBA.
- By changing the Excel CSV file into lists of Phython, the data can be run with shorter Loop runs and less complex code. As compared in Excel VBA larger loop and more complex script needs to be written.

Disadvantage of using Python:
- Needs to be aware of indentations. Indentation can highly affect how the script is being run.
- Needs to know to convert the values in CSV to float, integer and convert back to string when print out messages
